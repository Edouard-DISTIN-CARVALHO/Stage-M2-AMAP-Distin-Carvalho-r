Bark is an important key component in the fire resistance strategy of species that live in fire-prone ecosystems (Pausas et al., 2014). It is an important structural component for tree architecture, and its thickness and rigidity contribute substantially to supporting the stem (Rossel et al., 2019). But the structural investment in bark can have physiological consequences for the tree, such as limiting the diffusion of water, oxygen and CO2 between the vascular cambium and the atmosphere (Teskey et al. 2007). These limitations can affect the survival of trees under a fire regime intensified by extreme drought. 

By influencing the amount of diffusion of CO2 out of the trunk, bark characteristics also have the potential to act as important determinants of plant carbon dynamics at both the individual and ecosystem level (Berry et al., 2021). However, the link between plant ecophysiology and ecosystem carbon balances is still far from clear, especially in relation with stem-based metabolism and nutrient transport (Rowland et al., 2018). Linking patterns in the rate of efflux of CO2 from stems to bark functional traits will therefore improve our understanding of plant fitness and performance, vulnerability of metabolic activities and response to stressors.

This proposal thus aims to investigate the influence of functional traits of the bark in relation to respiration rates of the main stem in trees established in fire-prone ecosystems. With this premise we can test the ecological hypotheses of trade-offs between a) stem respiration and water conservation; b) stem respiration and fire protection. The project will make use of a long-term stem respiration dataset collected over seven years (2018 – 2024) across more than 90 trees, and will relate it to functional trait data which is to be collected in the field in March 2025. Since the project will be framed within the context of a controlled fire experiment, the student will be able investigate which traits are stronger determinants of stem carbon efflux in the presence and absence of fire. 


## Questions : 

What is the impact of fire on stem repiration of Cerrado trees in the time ? 
How did the bark functionnal traits influenced the stem respiration of Cerrado trees ?  
What is the impact of bark functional traits of Cerrado trees 

1) **What is the impact of fire on stem respiration of Cerrado trees over time?** 
H0 : In the long term, trees subjected to frequent fires would exhibit lower respiration rates.
H1 : In the long term, trees subjected to frequent fires would has no change in their respiration rates.

2) **How do the  barks functional traits influence the stem respiration of Cerrado trees?** 
H0 : Trees with thicker bark would have lower respiration rates than trees with thinner bark.
H1 : Trees with thicker bark would not have changed their respiration rates compared to trees with thinner bark.

3) **What is the impact of the barks functional traits in Cerrado trees subjected to variations in fire regime?**
H0 : Trees with thicker bark that are exposed to more frequent fires would have lower respiration rates than trees with thinner bark that experience fewer fires.
H1 : There are no change of stem respiration between trees exposed to more frequent fire with thicker bark and trees exposed to fewer fires with thinner bark.
